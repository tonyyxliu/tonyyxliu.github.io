## Biography

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in computer science supervised by [Prof.Yeh-Ching Chung（钟叶青教授）](https://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~ychung/) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and I am about to graduate in 2027.

My main research interests include:
* Load Generation for Latency-Critical Workloads
* Workload Characterization
* Optimized Request Scheduling Algorithm for Short Tail Latency with Bypass OS ([Survey Slides](../files/slides/2024-Spring-CSC6032-Project-Slides-Request-Scheduling-For-Low-Tail-Latency.pptx))

Some other fields also interest me:
* FPGA Acceleration of AI Computation (Microsoft's Catapult and Brainwave Project, [Survey Slides](../files/slides/2023-Fall-CSC6031-Project-Slides-FPGA-AI-Acceleration.pptx))
* Optimized Execution Plan of Graph Pattern Match
* AI Compiler (TVM, IREE)

Before my Ph.D., I obtained my Bachelor's degree of engineering, majored in computer science and engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. During my junior and senior years, I interned as a front-end software developer at Kingdee and Tencent.

I am about to continuously upload blog posts to talk about things that interest me. Hopefully, you would like them! (^v^)
