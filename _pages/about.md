## Autobiography

I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in computer science supervised by Prof.Yeh-Ching Chung in the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and am about to graduate in 2027.

My research interests includes the design and implementation of load generator for latency-critical workloads, workload characterization, and how to take advantage of the loadgen simulation data to better optimize the system performance like request scheduling with bypass OS. I have also done a research project with Alibaba Inc related to graph computing, specifically, optimizing the execution plan of graph pattern match for fast graph query.

Before my Ph.D., I obtained my Bachelor's degree on computer and information engineering in the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. During my junior and senior years, I was doing an internship in Kingdee and Tencent as a frontend software developer.

I am about to continuously upload blog posts to talk about things that interest me, and hopefully you would like them.
