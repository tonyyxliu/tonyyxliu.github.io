                    Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans, "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All if tgus
                    left scars on me."</li>
                <li> <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service </li>
                <li> <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Get laid of due to budget cuts.
                    Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about
                    bredding pest-resistent plants.</li>
                <li> <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is
                    rejected. Instead =, military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
                    disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
                <li> <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                <li> <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant
                    wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team
                    bredds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each
                    major climate on Earth.</li>
                <li> <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields
                </li>
                <li> <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeilding American
                    breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's
                    wheat.</li>
                <li> <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yeilding strains of wheat to the Indian
                    subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding poppulation</li>
                <li> <strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                <li> <strong>1983</strong> - helps African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum
                    yields</li>
                <li> <strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
                <li> <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that
                    genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land.
                    Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and
                    aminals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
                </li>
                <li> <strong>2009</strong> - Dies at the age of 95.</li>
