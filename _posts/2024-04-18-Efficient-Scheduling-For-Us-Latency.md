This is the presentation slides of course CSC6032: Advanced Operating System instructed by [Prof.Yeh-Ching Chung（钟叶青教授）](https://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~ychung/). The presentation is a survey of state-of-the-art scheduling policies to schedule microsecond-level tasks to get optimized tail latency while not losing too much throughput.
